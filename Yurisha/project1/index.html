<h1><b>Books: Importance</b></h1>
<br>
<img src="images/pic2.PNG" width="600px">
<p>It is said that "When you open a book, you open a new world." Everyone would agree with this statement as books have become inevitable to mankind and they take us into a different world of imagination. Books broaden our outlook, drive away from our narrow prejudices and lighten up our minds with truth and knowledge. In simple words, to define, a book is a set of pages that have been fastened together inside a cover to be read. Books play a significant role in our life.<br><br>

    Books are a great blessing to mankind. They help us to keep in touch with the times. We get to know what is happening in the world. Besides, they help us to speak languages fluently and communicate spontaneously. Importantly, books can be our guide, philosopher, and teacher. As said by Mahatma Gandhi, "When I was in distress, I got to the lap of mother Gita to get solace." By mother Gita, he means Bhagwad Gita, the great gospel book of truth. From this statement, we can acknowledge the huge importance of books.
    <br><br>
    In this 21st century, books can be had on every branch of knowledge, whether it is science, art, literature, psychology, or any other subjects. There are various types of books. Some are meant for serious reading like for recreation and entertainment. Likewise, numerous books and books on satire amuse us. Biographies of great personalities inspire us to do great deeds. For example, Abraham Lincoln read the biography of George Washington, the first president of America then got inspired and became the U.S. president himself. So in this way, books have played a pivotal role in the lives of all great men.
    <br><br>
    Books are our never-failing companions because they teach us, influence us; they change the very course of our life. A friend may deceive but surely not a book. Books are also a great way of healthy amusement. They are one of the great ways of passing our spare time pleasantly. Many books relieve us from our mental suffering. However, books not only give us pleasure, but they also inform us about ancient civilization and lore. Through books, we can reap the advantage from the experience of noble minds like Valmiki, Kalidas, Tagore, Shakespeare, Aristotle, and many more.
    <br><br>
    However, we have to be very careful in our selection of books. Once the wise author of "Ecclesiastes" had said, "Of the making of many books, there is no end." Yes, in this world of today, we find countless books-good, bad, and indifferent. Good books tone up our intellectual taste and make our outlook broad whereas bad books spoil our character and ruin our intellect as well as waste our time and energy. So, we should be very selective towards books. Also, the great writer Bacon, in his essay "of studies" had said "Some books are to be tasted, some to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, in a nutshell, books are immortal divine storehouses of human wisdom and knowledge which make us noble and civilized. Books dispel darkness and take us from happiness to enlightenment. Moreover, it is said that "The more you read, the more well-read you are." Yes, I believe that our personality, behavior, ideas, and knowledge are all we read. So, at last, to wrap up, we should wisely select good books and read them to develop our society, country, and the world as a whole because without books no fresh ideas are possible and without fresh ideas no cultured society is possible.<br><br>
